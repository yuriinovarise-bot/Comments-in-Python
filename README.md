Comments in Python

In Python, you can leave comments in your code. Comments are used to explain what your code does, and they are ignored when the program runs.

There are two types of comments: single-line and multi-line.

Single-line Comments

A single-line comment starts with the # symbol.

Example:

# This is a single-line comment

Multi-line Comments

To write a comment that spans several lines, use triple quotes (""" or '''):

"""
This is a multi-line comment.
You can write multiple lines here.
"""

test = 'abc'

Task №2 ⊗pyPmBsCm

You are given the following lines:

test2 = '123'
